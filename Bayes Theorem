Bayes Therom

how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.
It provides a way to calculate the conditional probability of an event, given 
prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

formula -> P(A/B) =  P(B|A) * P(A) / p(B)

Normally, only 10 out of 100 emails you get are spam. (So, 10% of emails are spam.)

But today, you see an email with the word "prize" in it.

You know that spam emails often say "prize" (maybe 80% of spam emails have that word).

But normal emails almost never say "prize" (only 1% of normal emails have that word).

    You wake up and see that the ground is wet.

    You think: "Maybe it rained last night."

    But you also remember: "Maybe someone watered the garden."

Bayes' Theorem helps you answer:
👉 “Given that the ground is wet, how likely is it that it rained?”

It uses what you knew before (your guess before seeing the wet ground) and what you see 
now (the wet ground) to make a better guess.
