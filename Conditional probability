Conditional probability 
means the chance of something happening when you already know that something else has happened

P(A∣B)=P(B)P(A∩B)​

Example:

If you have a deck of cards and you know the card drawn is a red card, what is the probability that it is a heart?

    Probability of heart given red:

P(Heart | Red)=1326=0.5
P(Heart | Red)=2613​=0.5

Because there are 13 hearts out of 26 red cards.


The True Positive Rate (TPR), also known as Sensitivity, measures how well a test identifies defective parts correctly.
TPR= True Positives​/Total Defective Parts
