 CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) 
gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a specific value

Example:
If CDF(10) = 0.8, it means:
    There is an 80% chance that the value is 10 or less

P ->(0-1)

cumsum -> cumsum means adding up numbers step by step.
          For example:
          If you have parts like this:
          [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
          Where 1 = defective and 0 = non-defective.

Why we use it in defect checking?

We use cumsum to keep count of how many defective parts we have found so far.
It helps to track defects over time and see if the defect rate is increasing or stable.

This is useful in manufacturing to check if the production is doing well or needs improvement!
