Bernoulli Distribution — One Trial

    Think of it as a special case of the Binomial distribution with just 1 trial.

    It tells the probability of success (1) or failure (0) in a single experiment.

Example:

    Toss a coin once → Get head (1) or tail (0)

    Check if a light bulb is defective or not (1 = defective, 0 = not


--------

Binomial Distribution — Multiple Trials

    This is the sum of several independent Bernoulli trials.

    It tells the probability of getting a certain number of successes in n trials.

Example:

    Toss a coin 10 times → What’s the chance of getting 6 heads?

    Test 100 bulbs → What’s the chance that exactly 3 are defective?


-> Relationship Between Them

    Bernoulli is the building block of Binomial.

    If you repeat Bernoulli trials n times, the total number of successes follows a Binomial distribution.


Binomial Distribution formula :- 
    P(X=k) =  (k/n​)*p k(1−p)n− k

n = total number of trials

kk = number of successes you want

pp = probability of success

(nk)(kn​) = combinations (ways to choose kk successes out of nn trials)
