Type I Error (False Positive):
    Rejecting the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually true.

Example:
Suppose we are testing whether the average exam score is 75.

    H₀: The average score = 75

    H₁: The average score ≠ 75

If the true average is indeed 75, but our test leads us to reject H₀, we have made a Type I Error.

    Type II Error (False Negative):
    Failing to reject the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually false.

Example:
If the actual average exam score is 70, but our test fails to reject H₀ (we conclude the average is 75), we have committed a Type II Error
