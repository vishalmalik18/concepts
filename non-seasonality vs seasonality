Non-seasonal time series

No fixed, repeating cycle

Data does not follow a predictable repetition

Example: stock prices

Seasonal time series

Follows a predictable, repeating pattern

Happens at consistent time intervals (every day, week, month, year)

Example: ice cream sales rise every summer


Cyclic means up-and-down movements in the data that:

Do NOT repeat at fixed intervals

Are NOT predictable like seasonality

Last for longer periods (years, decades)


Stationary means NO trend

Because in stationary data, the mean stays constant over time.

But trend means the mean is changing over time.

So:

👉 If data has trend, it cannot be stationary.
👉 If data is stationary, it cannot have a trend.


if data is a costant varience remains same
