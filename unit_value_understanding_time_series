# ⭐ Case 1: ϕ = 1

### 📌 Meaning: “Today = yesterday + random change”

### 📌 What happens: It **keeps going up and down forever**, no stability.

### Example:

Imagine a drunk person walking:

* Step 1: stands at position 0
* Step 2: moves +1 step
* Step 3: moves –2 steps
* Step 4: moves +3 steps

He **never comes back to a fixed place**.
He just **wanders randomly**.

This is **non-stationary**.

# ⭐ Case 2: ϕ < 1

### 📌 Meaning: “Today depends a little on yesterday.”

### 📌 What happens: It stays around some average value.

### Example:

Temperature:

* 29°C
* 31°C
* 30°C
* 28°C
* 32°C

It goes up and down
BUT
it always comes back around **30°C**.

This is **stationary**.

# ⭐ Case 3: ϕ > 1

### 📌 Meaning: “Today becomes even BIGGER than yesterday.”

### 📌 What happens: Numbers **explode**.

### Example:

Someone doubles money every day:

* ₹100
* ₹120
* ₹144
* ₹172
* ₹207
* ... keeps growing

This **blows up**.

This is **explosive**, not stationary.

# ⭐ Final SIMPLE summary:

| ϕ value   | Easy meaning                          | What happens                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **ϕ = 1** | Today = yesterday                     | Wanders randomly → not stable |
| **ϕ < 1** | Today depends *a little* on yesterday | Stays around a stable mean    |
| **ϕ > 1** | Today becomes bigger than yesterday   | Explodes forever              |

---

# ⭐ SUPER SIMPLE one-line explanation:

* **ϕ = 1 → No stability (random walk)**
* **ϕ < 1 → Stable (stationary)**
* **ϕ > 1 → Explodes (blows up)**
